# SpaceVis
The system serves two primary engineering objectives: first, to provide a transparent visualization of multivariate sensor degradation; and second, to enable active parameter optimization.
By allowing the user to manipulate operational variables, the framework demonstrates how algorithmic predictions can be converted into actionable maintenance prescriptions that maximize
asset utility under stress.
